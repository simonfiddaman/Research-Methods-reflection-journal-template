## How to Use

### Main Notes (`notes.md`)

The `notes.md` file is your central place for capturing module content:

- **Weekly Sections**: Each week has dedicated space for topics covered, key points, and questions
- **Key Concepts**: A section for organizing important research methods concepts by category
- **Additional Resources**: Track helpful readings, websites, and tools

**Tip:** Update this file as you progress through lectures, readings, and assignments.

### Weekly Reflections (`reflections/`)

Each week has a dedicated reflection journal file structured to help you:

- **Document learning**: Record main topics and new concepts
- **Identify challenges**: Note difficulties and how you overcame them
- **Make connections**: Link new knowledge to previous learning
- **Plan ahead**: Set action items for the following week
- **Reflect**: Summarize your overall learning experience

**Tip:** Complete each reflection at the end of the corresponding week while the content is fresh in your mind.

## Getting Started

1. Start with `notes.md` in Week 1 to record lecture and reading notes
2. At the end of Week 1, complete `reflections/week1-reflection.md`
3. Continue this pattern throughout the 8-week module
4. Use the Key Concepts section in `notes.md` to build a reference guide

## Tips for Effective Note-Taking

- Be consistent with your note-taking schedule
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Link related concepts between weeks
- Review previous weeks' notes before starting a new week
- Use the reflections to identify patterns in your learning
- Keep action items specific and measurable
