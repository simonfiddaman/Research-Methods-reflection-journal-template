## Textbooks

There are many textbooks on research methods and doing research, all of which have their strengths and limitations. This module has two core texts, which are:

- Creswell, J. W. and Creswell, J. D., (2018). Research Design: Qualitative and Quantitative & Mixed Methods Approaches. 5th Ed. London: Sage Publications
- Zobel, J. (2014) Writing for Computer Science. 3rd Ed. Springer, London.

The Creswell book explains research design in a comprehensible way, making it an ideal text for this module, while Zobel's book provides straightforward, step-by-step guidance on how to write for computer science.

## Module Learning Outcomes (MLOs)

By the end of this module students will be able to:

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.

## Weekly Learning Outcomes (WLOs) — mapped to MLOs

Below are concise weekly learning outcomes designed to guide readings, activities and reflections. Each WLO includes the primary MLOs it maps to.

- Use these WLOs to guide weekly reflections and evidence collection for assessments.
- Each weekly reflection should map activities back to the WLOs and at least one overall MLO.

### Week 1 — Introduction to research, academic writing

- Understand what research is and how it applies to computer science. (MLO3)
- Describe research approaches at a high level. (MLO2, MLO3, MLO4)
- Demonstrate academic writing fundamentals (paragraphs, paraphrase, analysis). (MLO3)
- [Week 1 reflection journal](reflections/week1-reflection.md)

### Week 2 — Research terminology, methodology and planning

- Distinguish between methodology and methods; outline common research approaches. (MLO1, MLO2, MLO4)
- Identify research strategies and plan a basic research design. (MLO1, MLO3)
- Understand validity and stakeholder perspectives in research design. (MLO3)
- [Week 2 reflection journal](reflections/week2-reflection.md)

### Week 3 — Quantitative research foundations

- Summarise quantitative vs qualitative data and typical methods in CS research. (MLO2, MLO4)
- Explain key concepts: variables, constructs, hypothesis-driven research, induction vs deduction. (MLO1, MLO2, MLO4)
- Interpret basic descriptive and inferential statistics. (MLO2, MLO4)
- [Week 3 reflection journal](reflections/week3-reflection.md)

### Week 4 — Quantitative data analysis

- Apply descriptive and inferential analysis concepts to example datasets. (MLO2, MLO3, MLO4)
- Choose appropriate statistical tests and represent quantitative data clearly. (MLO2, MLO4)
- [Week 4 reflection journal](reflections/week4-reflection.md)

### Week 5 — Qualitative research methods

- Describe qualitative methodologies and common primary data collection techniques. (MLO2, MLO3, MLO4)
- Explain when mixed-methods or case studies are appropriate. (MLO3)
- [Week 5 reflection journal](reflections/week5-reflection.md)

### Week 6 — Qualitative analysis and interpretation

- Compare qualitative data gathering methods and demonstrate thematic analysis. (MLO1, MLO2, MLO4)
- Draw valid conclusions from qualitative data and reflect critically on evidence. (MLO2, MLO4)
- [Week 6 reflection journal](reflections/week6-reflection.md)

### Week 7 — Evaluation, ethics and research quality

- Critically evaluate research quality, validity and ethics. (MLO3, MLO4)
- Reflect on personal research skills and plan next steps for an independent project. (MLO2, MLO4)
- [Week 7 reflection journal](reflections/week7-reflection.md)
