# Research Methods — Structured weekly overview & reflection template

This file combines weekly topics, weekly learning outcomes (WLOs), suggested individual tasks, and a compact reflection template so weekly reflections are consistent and useful for assessment.

Refer to `MLOs.md` for module-level outcomes and mapping.

## How to use this file

- For each week, follow the **Focus**, complete the **Tasks**, then fill the **Reflection** prompts.

- Keep reflections concise (200–400 words) and explicitly map to the week's WLOs and at least one overall MLO.

### Week 3 — Quantitative research methods

#### Week 3 — Focus

- Quantitative vs qualitative, variables, hypothesis testing basics.

#### Week 3 — WLOs

- Understand quantitative methods and variable use (MLO2, MLO4)

- Argue induction vs deduction use where relevant (MLO3)

#### Week 3 — Tasks

- Read Lessons 1–4 for Week 3.

- Participate in hypothesis testing discussion.

- Small exercise: draft a simple hypothesis and choose two possible statistical tests.

#### Week 3 — Reflection prompts

- Why did you pick the tests? Map choice to test assumptions and data type.

- How would your hypothesis change if taking a qualitative perspective?

---

### Week 4 — Quantitative methods, data collection and analysis

#### Week 4 — Focus

- Descriptive/inferential analysis, graphical representation, significance testing.

#### Week 4 — WLOs

- Use t-tests and interpret p-values & effect sizes (MLO2)

#### Week 4 — Tasks

- Follow lab/Activity: SPSS tool or equivalent (R/Python).

- Produce at least two graphs for sample dataset and write brief interpretation.

- Complete week discussion (reflective exercise).

#### Week 4 — Reflection prompts

- What did the analysis reveal? Were results practically significant?

- What would you change in the data collection to improve inference?

---

### Week 5 — Qualitative research methods

#### Week 5 — Focus

- Qualitative methodologies, sampling and primary data collection.

#### Week 5 — WLOs

- Understand qualitative methodologies and when to mix methods (MLO2, MLO3)

#### Week 5 — Tasks

- Read Lesson 1–3 for Week 5; complete Padlet activity.

- Sketch a primary data collection plan (interviews/focus groups/case study).

- Identify ethical considerations for your plan.

#### Week 5 — Reflection prompts

- What sampling strategy did you choose and why?

- What are the main ethical risks and how will you address them?

---

### Week 6 — Qualitative methods, data collection and analysis

#### Week 6 — Focus

- Thematic analysis, presenting qualitative findings, drawing conclusions.

#### Week 6 — WLOs

- Demonstrate thematic analysis and compare data gathering methods (MLO1, MLO2)

- Draw valid qualitative conclusions (MLO2, MLO4)

#### Week 6 — Tasks

- Complete a mini thematic analysis on a provided transcript or short dataset.

- Produce 3 themes with supporting quotes/notes.

- Share findings in Week 6 discussion.

#### Week 6 — Reflection prompts

- How did you move from raw data to themes?

- Where is reflexivity important in your analysis?

---

### Week 7 — Evaluation, validity & ethics

#### Week 7 — Focus

- Evaluating research quality, ethical practice, planning your independent project.

#### Week 7 — WLOs

- Critically evaluate research quality and ethics (MLO3, MLO4)

- Identify personal research skill gaps and next steps (MLO2, MLO4)

#### Week 7 — Tasks

- Complete module summary and evaluation readings.

- Produce a short research project plan (1–2 pages): question, method(s), timeline, ethics, evaluation criteria.

- Complete Week 7 Padlet/Discussion.

#### Week 7 — Reflection prompts

- How will you ensure your project meets validity and ethical standards?

- Which skills will you develop before starting the project?

### Reflection template (copy for each week)

- Week: [n]

- Focus & WLOs: [one-line mapping to WLOs]

- Activities completed: [bullets]

- Key learning(s): [3–4 bullets]

- Evidence produced: [list files/artifacts or links]

- Challenges/Questions: [2–3 bullets]

- Actions for next week: [2 bullets] (explicit, time-boxed)

---

### Quick tips for better reflections

- Always reference at least one WLO and one overall MLO.

- Keep evidence links or file names consistent so you can collect them for assessment.

- Use the "Actions for next week" to track skill development.

### Module resources and assessment mapping

- Map all major assessments to the MLOs in `MLOs.md` when preparing submissions.

- Keep a simple folder per week with: notes.md, artifacts (plots, transcripts), reflection.md.
