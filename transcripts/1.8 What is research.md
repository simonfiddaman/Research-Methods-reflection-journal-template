# Week 1 – What is research?

## Understanding Research

“Welcome to the first lecture for this unit, Research Methods, which offers a short introduction into understanding research, what it is and why we do it.“

“We should really begin this module by establishing what is meant by ‘research’ given that it can have different meanings dependent upon the purpose of the research, the context in which it is being undertaken and who is doing it, and for whom. As students enrolled on a University Masters programme within the Computer Science department, two perspectives have relevance: academic research and scientific research.

We should also ask why we do research exploring possible answers from the different perspectives of academia and science.”

## What is Research

“We perform research all the time, whether it be to work out the most efficient way to travel from one destination to another, decide which car/house/pair of shoes to buy, consider which university programme to enrol on or decide how to plan and implement a project at home or at work. The point is we are constantly gathering information and data to facilitate decision-making in our everyday lives, simply put, people undertake research to find things out.”

Research can be defined as “*The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions.*”

Or, put more simply, “Research is something that people undertake in order to find out things in a systematic way, thereby increasing their knowledge.

Whilst quite a broad definition, of importance here is the use of the word ‘systematic’. Rather than problem solving and making decisions based upon ‘gut feel’, ‘having a hunch’ about something or anecdote, research is a methodical way of gathering valid evidence and reliable data to draw sound conclusions, support decision-making and take appropriate action.

There are many reasons why we want to ‘find out’ information; in terms of Computer Science, research might be conducted in order to understand why a search engine does not perform better spelling correction or understand network delays and their routing algorithms or it could be used to contradict a current understanding or the reliability of the performance of some code. Research and development is essential to product innovation and the advancement of knowledge and technology.

Within the discipline of computer science, there is a distinction between academic and scientific research and it’s important that we understand this from the outset.”

## What is Research?

> Slide shows text: Title – What is research? Computer Science is a fairly new discipline, suffers from ‘lack of identity’ although it combines the experience of its main roots, namely in maths and engineering.

“From an academic perspective, research has a specific function, where the goal is to gather empirical evidence (verifiable facts and data) to develop and support theory building. Whilst highly appropriate to the academic pursuit of advancing knowledge, the focus on theory does not always provide practical, workable solutions for specific technical issues and problems that computer scientists face in their day to day work.”

## The basic–applied research continuum

>**The basic–applied research continuum**

>|  | Basic research <--- | ---> Applied research |
>|---:|---:|:---|
>| Purpose | Expand knowledge of processes and problems. | Improve understanding of a particular computer problem. |
>| Results in | Universal principles relating to the processes and their relationship to outcomes. | A solution; new knowledge limited to the problem; findings of practical relevance and value to organisations. |
>| Context | Undertaken in universities; choice of topic and objectives determined by researcher; flexible time scales. | Undertaken by people in a variety of settings including organisations and universities; objectives negotiated with originator; tight time scales. |

“Some state that CS research is a ‘well established discipline’ and that it has all it needs to be considered alongside other science with a long history. Either view that the roots of computing affect the research paradigm which is positivism and realism which is the main paradigm of natural and life sciences.

So what does this distinction between academic and practical research look like?

The nature of research, whether it leans towards a more academic, pure form of theory building or towards practical, relevant and purposeful problem solving, is dependent upon the purpose and context of the research. We can see the differences outlined in the table.

Basic research concerns itself with fundamentals of organizing and managing, advancing knowledge and theory whereas applied research concerns itself with solutions focused understanding of specific problems; it has to have some practical consequence, in other words, applied research has direct relevance to managers or scientists, addresses issues which they regard as important with actionable outcomes of value.

Regardless of where along the continuum a research project sits, it has to be conducted with rigour and this can be achieved through the research process, which we will consider in more detail later in this Unit.

For now, let’s think a bit more about why we should do research, as students and as computer scientists.”

## Why do Research?

> Slide shows text: Title – Why do Research? Shows two lists, one for a student and one for a computer scientist. As a Student: Preparation for research project, Develop research skills, View ‘facts’ with a critical eye, Critically reflect on your own practice. As a computer scientist: Understand complexities and issues relating to CS, Problem solving skills, Creativity / innovative thinking, Informed decision making, Evidence based practice.

“Throughout this module we will be considering research from two perspectives. First, to gain in-depth understanding of research, the research process and methodological choices available to you in preparation for your Independent Research Project, as part of your Masters programme. Each week, you will be asked to complete individual tasks which are designed to help you in your preparations for your own research project.

Second, organisations, scientific organisations or educational organisations have to be forward-facing, agile and adaptable to compete in a globalised world; research is one of the pillars of advancement in science and technology. The omnipresence of computers have not only affected the lifestyles of human beings but has also changed the interconnection between all sectors of science and humanities.

Each week, you will engage with key literature and real-world examples to evaluate how research can offer a meaningful and effective contribution to science and technology.“

## In summary

Slide shows text: Title – In summary. Three points: Research is a systematic process to investigate real problems/issues. It may have a very practical focus specific to an organisation or problem (applied). It may be concerned with building theory which can be generalised across many context (basic).

“Computer Science is largely a synthetic discipline. That is, the phenomenon studied by most practitioners have been created by people rather than ‘given’ by nature.

Computer science research is the systematic investigative process employed to increase or revise current knowledge by discovering new facts and new ways of doing things. It is divided into two general categories:

* Basic research is inquiry aimed at increasing scientific knowledge

* Applied research is effort aimed at using basic research for solving problems or developing processes, products or techniques.

The key take away points are that research is a process which takes different forms depending on the purpose of the research and the context within which it takes place. We will explore these ideas in more depth as the module progresses.“
