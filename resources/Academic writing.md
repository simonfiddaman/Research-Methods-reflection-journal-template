# Academic writing

MSc Computer Science

## Structuring your work

Overall structure

- Always include an introduction and a conclusion.
- Divide longer texts into chapters or sections with clear headings.
- Make sure information is presented in a logical order.

Paragraph structure

- Start a new paragraph when you move onto a new idea.
- Use a topic sentence at the start of each paragraph to indicate what it’s about, and make clear transitions between paragraphs.
- Make sure every paragraph is relevant to your argument or question.

Sentence structure

- Use transition words to express the connections between different ideas within and between sentences.
- Use appropriate punctuation to avoid sentence fragments or run-on sentences.
- Use a variety of sentence lengths and structures.

Academic writing uses sources to support its claims. Sources are other texts (or media objects like photographs or films) that the author analyses or uses as evidence.

Many of your sources will be written by other academics; academic writing is collaborative and builds on previous research.

- use verb tenses appropriately

## descriptive writing versus academic writing

| descriptive writing | critical / analytical writing |
| :---- | :---- |
| States  or describes what happened | Identifies the significance |
| Gives / details the story so far | Weighs one piece of information against another |
| States the order in which things happened | Makes reasoned judgements |
| Says when something occurred | Identifies why the timing is important |
| Explains what a theory says | Shows why something is relevant or suitable |
| States / details what something is like | Evaluates (judges the value) strengths and weaknesses  |
| Lists details | Evaluates the relative significance of details  |
| States the different components | Weighs up the importance of component parts  |
| States links between items | Shows the relevance of links between pieces of information  |
| Lists in any order | Structures information in order (eg. of importance) |
| Says / states / describes how to do something | Argues a case according to evidence |
| Explains how something works | Indicates why something will work (best) |
| Notes the method used | Indicates whether something is appropriate or suitable |
| States options | Gives reason for the selection of each option |
| Gives information | Draws conclusions |

## Avoid personalisation

- In my opinion…
- I think that…
- I like/dislike…
- I conducted interviews with…
- I argue that…
- I hope to achieve…

Your writing needs formalising.

## Emotive language

- This horrible tragedy was obviously one of the worst catastrophes in construction history.
- The injury and mortality rates of this accident were among the highest in construction history.

## Oddly blank heading

The use of 3D technology in the film Avatar transformed the way big-budget movies are made.

> _Who says?_
>
> _Prove it!_

This is not a fact. Other people might have a different opinion. Therefore you need to support this claim with evidence.

## Justification

What about justification? It is the logical thinking that explains why the evidence supports the claim. It’s sometimes called the warrant. In many cases, the justification is not actually written down as part of the argument, as it an obvious assumption or widely held belief. The warrant here could be:

_Because Avatar used 3D technology in a new, ambitious way and achieved great financial success, other big-budget movies copied this technique in the hope they would make more money. In this way, Avatar changed the film industry, and transformed audience expectations._

## counter-arguments

Arguments can also include counter-arguments, this is where you anticipate potential rejections of your argument.

_Many other big-budget films after Avatar have not employed 3D. The James Bond movie, Spectre, made almost £900m in cinemas in 2015. Therefore, you don’t need to be 3D to be successful._

_Avatar did not invent the 3D film. The first commercially released 3D film was The Power of Love, produced in 1922._

## Evidence

The evidence is the data or information you use to support your claim.

_Avatar used 3D technology in a more ambitious way than ever before._

_Avatar earned £2.8bn in cinemas around the world, more than any other movie in history._

_After Avatar, the number of big-budget feature films using 3D technology increased dramatically (Motion Picture Association of America, 2017)._

_Six out of the ten most popular films shown in the UK in 2016 were available in 3D._

These pieces of evidence may be drawn from many different sources. When including the work of others, you need to reference it.

## limitations

In certain kinds of academic papers, it’s important to include what we call limitations. If you are reporting and analysing the results of a survey, for example, you need to talk about the weakest areas of your study. This could be related to the methodology or sample size, for instance:

> _This study was limited by the small sample size…_

## Activity

can you spot the claim, evidence, counter-argument and warrant?

### Part 1

- _Americans are 10 times more likely to be killed by guns than citizens of other developed countries (The American Journal of Medicine, 2016). Over 20% of Americans own guns, and the total number of firearms in the country is 265 million, more than one weapon for each adult (Azreal et al, 2016)._

### Part 2

- _While some argue that guns are a deterrent against crime, or that it is their right to bear arms, public opinion is now turning towards stricter gun control, with 52% in favour (Pew Research Center, 2017)._

### Part 3

- _This paper contends that in order to reduce gun crime, the simplest and most effective way is to control sales to the general public._

## Claims / assertions

The claim is where you where you make your main point – it's a key part of academic argument. If there's no claim, there's no argument.

You need to support your claim with evidence. We are talking about facts here, not opinions – good evidence backs up the points you make.

Justification is where you explain why the evidence supports the claim – sometimes this can be left out if it's obvious or a widely held belief.

Claim, evidence and justification all combine to produce a clear argument.

Counter-arguments are important. If you include them in your writing it shows that you have considered more than one side of an argument.

Tell your reader your limitations. This doesn't mean that your writing is lower quality but actually helps the reader understand your context better.
