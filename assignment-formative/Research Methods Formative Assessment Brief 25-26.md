# 1. **Module Learning Outcomes**

The module learning outcomes (MLOs) for this module are as follows:

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest and within the area of Computer Science.  
2. Outline methods of conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.  
3. Critically evaluate different methods of investigating an area of research interest and consider the nature of the relationship between the research question, methodology, and method.  
4. Critically assess the key characteristics of qualitative and quantitative research methods.

This formative assessment will contribute to **some** the module learning outcomes listed above.

# 2. **Assessment Background/Scenario**

So far, we have explored many key elements of the research process, including methodologies and methods as part of the Research Methods module. We have learnt that there are different ways to approach research and that the methodology and methods used are determined by what you are trying to find out – the research question. We have also learnt that all methodologies and methods have both benefits and limitations.

One of the learning outcomes for this module asks you to critically evaluate different methods of investigating an area of research interest and consider the nature of the relationship between the research question, methodology, and method. Another asks you to critically assess the key characteristics of qualitative and quantitative research methods. This formative assessment will focus on these two learning outcomes.

>At this level of study, there may be multiple “right answers” to any given problem. You may have to make assumptions about ambiguous or incomplete information, interpret the information provided, or make justifiable decisions about approaches and techniques to apply. These should flow from the information provided, your understanding of the course materials and your further research around the subject area under assessment. 
>
>To support your work and meet the high academic standards and requirements outlined in the assessment brief, you should clearly state your assumptions, interpretations, and decisions, providing justifications for each. Support your arguments with references from wider reading to demonstrate critical engagement with relevant literature. This will help the marker understand your reasoning and ensure you receive appropriate recognition and credit for your work. 
>
>Equally, you must incorporate or refer to other authors' research to support your assumptions, interpretations and decisions, with justifications. Academic writing relies on evidence from various sources to build a strong argument. Instead of summarising individual sources, integrate key evidence into a cohesive discussion. This approach shows that your work is based on more than just personal opinion.

# 3. **Assessment Tasks**

For this formative exercise, you are required to demonstrate your knowledge of developing research questions and research design, and how they may prove to be useful when investigating an area of interest.

You will be specifically focusing on **MLO1** and **MLO3**.

The learning you will take from this will inform your summative assignment for this module, Research Project Proposal, and your Independent Research Project.

Write an **800-word** report that addresses the following:

You have been provided with the following research aim (think of the research aim as the destination, and the research questions as the roadmap, providing specific directions to reach it.):

To develop and evaluate machine learning models for the detection of fraudulent activities in transactional data, with the goal of improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing real-time fraud prevention capabilities.

1) Develop research questions (no more than 3\) that fit the above mentioned pre-defined aim.   
2) Identify and critically evaluate suitable research methodologies and methods to address the research question.    
   1) Consider the nature of the relationship between the research question, methodology, and method.  
   2) Choose Two Research Methodologies: Compare one qualitative and one quantitative approach OR two different qualitative/quantitative methodologies (e.g., case study vs. survey).  
   3) Discuss the Strengths and Limitations of Each: Evaluate the appropriateness of each methodology based on the research question and practical considerations. 

Each decision you make must be accompanied by a clear rationale and supporting literature.

# 4. **Deliverables**

Your submission should contain the following files:

1. A single word-processed file (**.doc**, **.docx**) or **.pdf** which can be previewed in Canvas.

Your document should address the tasks in this brief. Your report should be no more than 800 words in total. There is no requirement for this report to contain any appendices, and they should only be considered where essential.

## Referencing

You are required to use the [IEEE referencing style](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/ieee) for citing books, articles, and all other sources (like websites) used in your assignment.

Good referencing is essential in order to meet the standards of academic integrity set by the University. All of your sources must be acknowledged, regardless of whether you included direct quotes or not. Visit your **Academic Integrity Tutorial** module in Canvas for additional guidance on effective referencing.

To learn more about academic integrity at the University of York, visit the [Academic integrity webpage](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/skills/integrity/).

## Layout and formatting guidelines

Formative assignments are a good opportunity to familiarise yourself with the standards expected in your summative assessment. Your work should be laid out using the following formatting standards:

* Apply 1.5 or 2.0 line spacing.  
* Use a consistent sans serif font, such as Arial or Calibri, in size 12\.  
* Your text should be left justified, not right justified or centrally justified.   
* Structure your work as meaningful paragraphs, rather than a single wall of text.  
* Only use bullet points where you are writing a definitive list, and use them sparingly. Don’t use bullet points to structure large bodies of text.  
* Don’t put any content into footnotes.  
* Include your word count on the front of your submission.  
* Follow the [IEEE referencing style](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/ieee) consistently throughout your work.

For further guidance on formatting conventions (such as appendices, images, tables, code and equations), follow the formatting guidelines provided in your summative assessment brief.

# 5. **Generative AI (GenAI) Policies**

The following information provides specific guidance for this assessment about what level of AI use is appropriate for this assessment. Please refer to the page called ‘AI in Assessment Framework’ in your module in Canvas for further guidance about how to understand and apply this framework to your assessment.

**Important:** Remember that in all cases you must submit work that is your own, acknowledging any part of it that has been provided by another source.

| Level of GenAI \- integration | Description | Level applies (Y/N)? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. No GenAI\*** | **GenAI must not be used** Your assignment should be produced using information sourced by you from your learning materials and academic sources and cited appropriately.   You are still permitted to use GenAI tools embedded within software for structure suggestions, checking spelling, grammar and referencing, but GenAI **cannot be used** to translate work. |  N  |
| **2\. GenAI\*–assisted idea development** | **Students are not allowed to create content in submitted assessments using GenAI** GenAI can **only** be used for pre-assessment tasks, such as for idea  brainstorming, idea generation, and structuring.

# 6. **Formative Feedback**

Formative activities do not contribute towards your final award and therefore you will not receive a mark for this assignment. However, you will receive feedback that will indicate how effectively you tackled the task, presented your ideas, and demonstrated academic best practice to the standard expected for Master’s level awards.

You will receive feedback in the following areas, which will support development of the module learning outcomes indicated:

| Areas of feedback |
| :---- |
| Structure of report, quality of critical evaluation and referencing. |
| Identification and critical evaluation of the question/hypothesis. |
| Research and discussions of methodologies and methods |

The feedback aims to support you in meeting the Module Learning Outcomes (MLOs) and the specific requirements of the assessment brief. It is designed to help you identify strengths in your current work, recognise areas for further development, and enhance the academic quality, critical engagement, and technical depth of your submission. By engaging with and addressing the feedback, you will be better equipped to meet the summative assessment requirements and demonstrate achievement of the MLOs, as well as the expected academic and professional standards for this module.

# 7. **Submitting work to Canvas**

You will submit your assessment in the [Assignments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsgHYI_elnFQjsmX1sUviww_rN52ncfOwAt1M9-3ZDk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x4oust6b8wxq) area of the module in Canvas. Please check your Canvas module for the specific submission date for this assignment.
