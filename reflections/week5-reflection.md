**Date:** _[Add date]_

**Module:** Research Methods (COM00146M)

## Quick reference

- Focus: Qualitative methodologies, sampling and primary data collection.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Describe qualitative methodologies and common primary data collection techniques. (MLO2, MLO3, MLO4)
  - [ ] Explain when mixed-methods or case studies are appropriate. (MLO3)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Read Lesson 1–3 for Week 5; complete Padlet activity.
  - [ ] Sketch a primary data collection plan (interviews/focus groups/case study).
  - [ ] Identify ethical considerations for your plan.

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] What sampling strategy did you choose and why?
  - [ ] What are the main ethical risks and how will you address them?

- Think about your skills in data modelling:
  - Do you have a preference for any particular methods, and if so, why?
  - Would you consider that one modelling technique is preferable to another?
  - How appropriate would your chosen modelling technique be in your research project?

## Summary

This week we have looked at the various methods of collecting your data. Your data collection instruments and methods should be designed around your research questions so that your methods will allow you to illuminate the questions. Gaining access to your participants is an important consideration.

By now, you should be able to explain the relationship between overall research purpose, methodological choices and formulation of good quality research questions for different types of research. You should have a clear idea of the types of source materials to review in order to help identify a credible research topic and define the scope of the research through formulating a good question.

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
