## Quick reference

- Focus: Evaluating research quality, ethical practice, planning your independent project.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Critically evaluate research quality, validity and ethics. (MLO3, MLO4)
  - [ ] Reflect on personal research skills and plan next steps for an independent project. (MLO2, MLO4)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Complete module summary and evaluation readings.
  - [ ] Produce a short research project plan (1–2 pages): question, method(s), timeline, ethics, evaluation criteria.
  - [ ] Complete Week 7 Padlet/Discussion.

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] How will you ensure your project meets validity and ethical standards?
  - [ ] Which skills will you develop before starting the project?

## Summary

In Week 7, we have taken time to reflect upon the research process and the role the researcher plays within that process. We have broadened our understanding of evaluation of good quality research and considered reflexivity as a means by which to monitor researcher bias and subjectivities in the research process. We finish by reflecting on the learning from the module, reviewing what research skills we have and what we still need to be able to confidently embark on our independent research projects.

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
