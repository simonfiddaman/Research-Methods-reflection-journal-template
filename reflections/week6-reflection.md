# Week 6 Reflection

**Date:** _[Add date]_

**Module:** Research Methods (COM00146M)

---

## Quick reference

- Focus: Thematic analysis, presenting qualitative findings, drawing conclusions.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Demonstrate thematic analysis and compare data gathering methods. (MLO1, MLO2)
  - [ ] Draw valid qualitative conclusions and reflect critically on evidence. (MLO2, MLO4)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Complete a mini thematic analysis on a provided transcript or short dataset.
  - [ ] Produce 3 themes with supporting quotes/notes.
  - [ ] Share findings in Week 6 discussion.

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] How did you move from raw data to themes?
  - [ ] Where is reflexivity important in your analysis?

- Readings:
  - in Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative & Mixed Methods Approaches:
    - [ ] Chapter 9, "Qualitative Methods"
  - [ ] [When it comes to data, skepticism matters](https://hbr.org/2014/10/when-it-comes-to-data-skepticism-matters)

## Summary

This week we have introduced methods for presenting qualitative data. We have examined:

- Transcripts and coding
- Discourse analysis
- Valid conclusions

Having already looked at computer science research it is important that qualitative data is not ruled out as not suitable for a CS project as most projects will have elements of human data in them and students need to have the knowledge and skills to code and represent that information or data.

_Summary of the week's learning experience:_

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
