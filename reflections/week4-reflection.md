# Week 4 Reflection

**Date:** _[Add date]_

**Module:** Research Methods (COM00146M)

---

## Quick reference

- Focus: Descriptive/inferential analysis, graphical representation, significance testing.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Apply descriptive and inferential analysis concepts to example datasets. (MLO2, MLO3, MLO4)
  - [ ] Choose appropriate statistical tests and represent quantitative data clearly. (MLO2, MLO4)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Follow lab/Activity: SPSS tool or equivalent (R/Python).
  - [ ] Produce at least two graphs for sample dataset and write brief interpretation.
  - [ ] Complete week discussion (reflective exercise).

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] What did the analysis reveal? Were results practically significant?
  - [ ] What would you change in the data collection to improve inference?

- Think about your own strengths and weaknesses in terms of methods to gather data:
  - Do you have a preference for any particular strategy and method(s) of data collection?
  - Would you consider that face-to-face research is more appropriate than the online kind?
  - How might the number of your sample affect the research outcome?

- Readings:
  - in Writing for Computer Science:
    - [ ] Chapter 4, "Hypotheses, Questions and Evidence"
    - [ ] Chapter 11, "Graphs, Figures and Tables"

## Summary

Building on from the learning in Week 3 on quantitative data collection, this week concentrated on the methods used to present this data and looked in depth at hypothesis testing, probability sampling and testing techniques. By now you should have a clear idea about the quantitative research approach, and how to obtain and present data collected in your research with the aim of addressing your research question. You should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the modelling of findings and justification of your research approach choice.

## Overall Reflection

_Summary of the week's learning experience:_

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
