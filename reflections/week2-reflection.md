# Week 2 Reflection

**Date:** _[Add date]_

**Module:** Research Methods (COM00146M)

---

## Quick reference

- Focus: Methods vs methodology, research strategies, planning.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Distinguish between methodology and methods; outline common research approaches. (MLO1, MLO2, MLO4)
  - [ ] Identify research strategies and plan a basic research design. (MLO1, MLO3)
  - [ ] Understand validity and stakeholder perspectives in research design. (MLO3)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Read lessons on research terminology and strategies.
  - [ ] Complete Padlet activities for research philosophy and project planning.
  - [ ] Produce a 1-page plan: research question, proposed approach, key stakeholders, and validity considerations.

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] How does your chosen approach fit the research question?
  - [ ] What validity threats did you identify and how will you mitigate them?

- Readings:
  - in Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative & Mixed Methods Approaches
    - [ ] Review Chapter 1, "The Selection of a Research Approach"
    - [ ] Chapter 10, "Mixed Method Procedures"
    - [ ] Chapter 3, "The Use of Theory"
    - [ ] Chapter 2, "Review of the Literature"
  - in Writing for Computer Science
    - [ ] _(Optional) Chapter 2 "Getting Started"_
    - [ ] Chapter 3 "Reading and Reviewing"
  - [ ] [A Quantitative Analysis of Model-Driven Code Generation through Software Experimentation](<../readings/A Quantitative Analysis of Model-Driven Code Generation through Software Experimentation.pdf>)
  - [ ] [Experimental Economics and Experimental Computer Science: A Survey](<../readings/Experimental Economics and Experimental Computer Science A Survey.pdf>)
  - [ ] [The use of ethnography in computer science research: a systematic literature review](<../readings/The use of ethnography in computer science research a systematic literature review.pdf>)

## Summary

This week we have introduced methodologies and how they differ from methods. We have discussed the different approaches to research in computer science, who the stakeholders may be, strategies for undertaking research and then moved on to research ethics and validity. We spent some time on sampling and looked more closely at literature reviews.

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
