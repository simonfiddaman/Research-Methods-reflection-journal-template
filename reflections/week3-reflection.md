# Week 3 Reflection

**Date:** _[Add date]_

**Module:** Research Methods (COM00146M)

---

## Quick reference

- Focus: Quantitative vs qualitative, variables, hypothesis testing basics.

- WLOs (week):
  - [ ] Summarise quantitative vs qualitative data and typical methods in CS research. (MLO2, MLO4)
  - [ ] Explain key concepts: variables, constructs, hypothesis-driven research, induction vs deduction. (MLO1, MLO2, MLO4)
  - [ ] Interpret basic descriptive and inferential statistics. (MLO2, MLO4)

- Key tasks (this week):
  - [ ] Read Lessons 1–4 for Week 3.
  - [ ] Participate in hypothesis testing discussion.
  - [ ] Small exercise: draft a simple hypothesis and choose two possible statistical tests.

- Reflection prompts (quick):
  - [ ] Why did you pick the tests? Map choice to test assumptions and data type.
  - [ ] How would your hypothesis change if taking a qualitative perspective?

- Readings:
  - in Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative & Mixed Methods Approaches:
    - [ ] Chapter 8, "Quantitative Methods"
  - in Writing for Computer Science:
    - [ ] Chapter 4 "Hypotheses, Questions and Evidence"
  - [ ] _(Optional) [Field, A.P. (2000) Discovering Statistics Using SPSS for Windows: Advanced Techniques for the Beginner](https://eu.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/44YORK_INST/citation/40294584910001381?auth=SAML)_

## Summary

Week 3 has considered a range of methods commonly available to conduct quantitative research in computer science.

Think about your own engagement with research, perhaps in the workplace and generally, and take some time to reflect upon the following:

- Do you have a preference for any particular strategy and/or method(s) of data collection?
- Would you consider alternative strategies and methods going forward?
- How might this impact on any research you engage with?

## Overall Reflection

_Summary of the week's learning experience:_

## Module-level MLOs (quick reference)

1. Formulate potential research questions appropriate to an area of interest within computer science.
2. Outline methods for conducting and analysing quantitative and qualitative research.
3. Critically evaluate methods of investigating a research topic and explain relationships between research question, methodology and methods.
4. Critically assess the key characteristics, strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
